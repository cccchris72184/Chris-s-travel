            Hagia Sophia, an architectural masterpiece in Istanbul, was completed in 537 AD under Emperor Justinian I as a cathedral. 
            Renowned for its massive dome and mesmerizing mosaics, it exemplifies Byzantine architecture and artistry. The building served 
            as the world’s largest cathedral for nearly 1,000 years before being converted into a mosque in 1453 following the Ottoman conquest. 
            In 1935, it became a museum, showcasing its rich history and diverse cultural influences. In 2020, Hagia Sophia was reconverted into a
             mosque, yet it remains open to visitors. Today, it stands as a symbol of Istanbul's complex heritage and a testament to human creativity.
